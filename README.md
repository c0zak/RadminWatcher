# RadminWatcher
Discreet recording of work screens <br>
<b>
Needs software to record screen, Radmin Viewer, and VM with more then 1 screens. Can work in win 7/10, for win 10 you can change netstat to native PS function.
</b><br>
To get started, you need to create a folder with monitored machines in the Radmin book. Name them alphabetically. Rewrite their IP addresses into a script. Create directories for recording, also add them to the script. Done, you can start it)<br>

I do not know under what license such code can and should be placed. So I came up with my own:<br>
1) Indicate in the comments to your project that this code or part of it was used<br>
2) Say a beer toast in my honor. You can even two ;)<br>
3) Don't use this code for evil(in this case, you can, but a little)<br>
